  "summary": "Frontend adds an admin-only “Reference Website” page, a React Query hook to get/save the reference data, an admin route for the page, and a read-only reminder card on the Admin Dashboard. Backend shows a new ReferenceWebsite type and state variable plus a migration module, but the diff excerpt does not show the required canister methods and admin-only enforcement for saving.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-19",
      "requirement": "Saving persists the URL/notes in the backend canister and is only allowed for admins; non-admin callers are rejected.",
      "reason": "The frontend calls `actor.getReferenceWebsite()` and `actor.setReferenceWebsite(...)`, but the backend diff excerpt only shows the new type and `referenceWebsite` variable; it does not show the `getReferenceWebsite`/`setReferenceWebsite` methods nor any admin-authorization checks rejecting non-admin callers.",
