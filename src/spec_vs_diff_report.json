  "summary": "REQ-44 is only partially addressed: the canonical googleMapsLink is kept, but the embed URL appears to use placeholder/fake data and the Contact page iframe uses a separate fallback query URL, so the embed is not clearly guaranteed to point to the exact same location as the provided maps.app.goo.gl link. REQ-45 is partially addressed with improved Tailwind styling, but the diff introduces new hardcoded English UI text (not via existing i18n keys), which conflicts with the requirement to keep using existing i18n keys.",

      "requirement": "Update CONTACT_INFO.googleMapsEmbedUrl to a valid Google Maps embed URL that shows the correct Rajdhani Beej Bhandar location using ONLY the provided location link, and ensure iframe + \"Open in Google Maps\" point to the same correct location.",
      "reason": "The embed URL in constants appears to contain placeholder/fake components (e.g., a dummy place id/params and generic coordinates), and the Contact page iframe uses googleMapsEmbedUrlFallback (a text query embed) rather than the canonical link-based embed; this does not demonstrate the embed is derived from/locked to the provided https://maps.app.goo.gl/ link nor that it will always show the exact same pin.",

      "requirement": "If the embed fails to load, the Contact page remains stable and usable (no crash) and the user still has a working \"Open in Google Maps\" link.",
      "reason": "While a mapError state is introduced, the provided diff excerpt does not show any iframe error handler (e.g., onError) or a rendered fallback UI/behavior when an embed fails, so it is not evidenced that failure handling is implemented.",
